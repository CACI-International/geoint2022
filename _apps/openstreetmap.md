name: OpenStreetMap
tagline: An open-source, crowd-sourced mapping data available on all security domains 
description: OSM relies on a diverse community of mappers, cartographers, and analysts using portable GPS devices, remotely sensed images, and other sources of knowledge to compile up-to-date, mapping information. Data generated by OSM is its primary output, not maps. Providing this OSM data allows users to do more than just display map tiles; users can download files for use in products or tools of their choice.
